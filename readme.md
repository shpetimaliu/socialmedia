I am working on creating a social media platform where users can create tweets, upload profile pictures, and write in real-time with other community members. It's just an experiment, and now it's in the initial phase where I connected the project with my GitHub (wish me luck 😂❤️).

- Today I used the backup copy of my code that I had saved while working on github after I ran into an express-session error, I couldn't figure out where the problem was with your setup but in the end it worked out. The problem is that in github now it says that publications and contributions have been lost, I can't understand why.
