I am working on creating a social media platform where users can create tweets, upload profile pictures, and write in real-time with other community members. It's just an experiment, and now it's in the initial phase where I connected the project with my GitHub (wish me luck 😂❤️).

- Today I used the backup of my code that I had saved while working on github after I ran into an `express-session` error, I couldn't figure out where the problem was with my setup, but it worked in the end. The problem is that in github now it says that publications and contributions have been lost, I don't understand why.

- Today I implemented Gravatar for the profile picture and if you use your Gravatar email for registration the webapp automatically uses your gravatar picture for the profile picture
